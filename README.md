Hello, fellow Rustaceans! 🦀

Welcome to Keyrock's RustFi repository. 

You can learn here more about our flagship Rust community event, RustFi Hackathon, and after the event, review published submissions.

The RustFi Hackathon is meant to foster the community by connecting talents and offering them space to freely create, innovate and learn - from each other and domain experts. Participants will be exploring possibilities and limits of Rust and creating financially viable and technically beautiful solutions, all while competing for a chunk of 100 000 EUR prize pool.
